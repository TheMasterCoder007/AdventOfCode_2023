# AdventOfCode_2023

In the year 2022 I discovered the wonderful realm of advent of code.
It was introduced to me by a co-worker and 2022 was my first time
giving the challenges a try. 

In 2020 I started a new job in the tech industry. I did not know how to 
program, but had a strong desire to learn. My dream after high school 
was to learn how to program, but due to the cost of school, and life 
circumstances, I ended up getting into the logging industry. Now that I
was given this opportunity I took my chance. I self-taught myself how to
write code in C and within 6 months of starting at this company moved into
a junior programming role.

In the year 2023 I moved into the position of team lead and then at the end
of the year into a firmware and hardware development role.

Due to working with embedded microprocessors, I work entirely in C. And prior
to becoming aware of advent of code, this is the only language I was proficient
at. I decided in 2022 that I would use advent of code to learn other frameworks
and languages. Each year I will choose a new language and attempt to learn it
through these challenges. Or at least until I learn all the ones that are useful
in the real development world. I may even go back and do prior years if time 
permits (I have two small kids).

Anyway, this is the backstory behind my journey as a software developer and my
goals with advent of code.
